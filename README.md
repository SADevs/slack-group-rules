# Slack SADevs Rules and Guidelines

1. Do not @channel in #general
2. Be nice to others
3. Respect each other
4. Don't make fun of PHP too much. It has feelings, too
5. Do not create redundant channels. For example, #javascript and #coffeescript. It's all the same thing. However, #javascript and #angular make sense.

If you have other additions to this rule set (this is a first draft), please submit them as a pull request.

Thanks, and happy chatting, San Antonio Developers!
