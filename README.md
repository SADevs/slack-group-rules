# Slack SADevs Rules and Guidelines

1. Do not @channel in #general.
1. Respect each other and the tools we use.
1. Check the channel list before you decide to make a new channel. If a channel already exists that you want to create, just join it and start chatting!
1. If you have an issue, contact an admin. You can see the list of admins down below.

If you have other additions to this rule set (this is a first draft), please submit them as a pull request.

Thanks, and happy chatting, San Antonio Developers!
