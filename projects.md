# Projects with SA Devs

Do you like to build things? Do you like to build things with other people? Do you like to go to meetups and use your laptop for cool things, like building projects?

Well, with SADevs, you can! There are plenty of meetups around, but the good news is that the power is yours! You can connect with anyone within the SADevs group, start working on a problem, and then publish it to your organization, project, or this page! Whatever you think is best.

This document really isn't for much other than encouraging you to go out, do something interesting with other people, and make cool stuff with computers.

Who knows? You might learn something. That's the absoluste _worst_ thing that could happen.

And who doesn't like learning something?

Have a good time with the community!
